# -64bit-Dual-Channel-Multiplier
This is a project of 64bit Dual-Channel Multiplier.  
And the project refers to the following paper:  
(https://www.researchgate.net/publication/330435847_Dual-Channel_Multiplier_for_Piecewise-Polynomial_Function_Evaluation_for_Low-Power_3-D_Graphics)  
  
Based on the Dual-Channel structure,extending it to a 64bit Mutiplier.  
And the Design documents can be seen in 'doc'.  
  
The codes include four parts:  
  1. multiplier.v  
  2. multiplier_unit.v
  3. full_add.v
  4. tb_multiplier.v
